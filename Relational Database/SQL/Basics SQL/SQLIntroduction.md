# SQl Useful Definition And Introduction

> ### Why Businesses Like Databases

- **_Data integrity is ensured_**

  - only the data you want entered is entered, and only certain users are able to enter data into the database.

- **_Data can be accessed quickly_**

  - SQL allows you to obtain results very quickly from the data stored in a database. Code can be optimized to quickly pull results.

- **_Data is easily shared_**
  - multiple individuals can access data stored in a database, and the data is the same for all users allowing for consistent results for anyone with access to your database.

> ### Types of Databases

- **_SQL Databases_**
  - Some of the most popular databases include
    - MySQL
    - Access
    - Oracle
    - Microsoft SQL Server
    - Postgres
  - Each of these SQL databases may have subtle differences in syntax and available functions
  - for example, MySQL doesnâ€™t have some of the functions for modifying dates as Postgres.

> ### Why SQL?

- There are some major advantages to using traditional relational databases, which we interact with using SQL.

- The five most apparent are:
  - SQL is easy to understand.
  - Traditional databases allow us to access data directly.
  - Traditional databases allow us to audit and replicate our data.
  - SQL is a great tool for analyzing multiple tables at once.
  - SQL allows you to analyze more complex questions than dashboard tools like Google Analytics.

> ### SQL vs. NoSQL

- These NoSQL environments tend to be particularly popular for web based data, but less popular for data that lives in spreadsheets the way we have been analyzing data up to this point.

> ### Entity Relationship Diagrams

- An entity relationship diagram (ERD) is a common way to view data in a database.

- These diagrams help us visualize the data we are analyzing including
  - The names of the tables.
  - The columns in each table.
  - The way the tables work together.
