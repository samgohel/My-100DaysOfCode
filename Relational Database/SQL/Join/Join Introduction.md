# SQL Join introduction and overview

> ### Database Normalization

- When creating a database, it is really important to think about how data will be stored.

- This is known as normalization, and it is a huge part of most SQL classes

- If we are in charge of setting up a new database, it is important to have a thorough understanding of database normalization.

- There are essentially three ideas that are aimed at database normalization:
  - Are the tables storing logical groupings of the data?
  - Can we make changes in a single location, rather than in many tables for the same information?
  - Can we access and manipulate data quickly and efficiently?

> ### Why We us Join?

- The whole purpose of JOIN statements is to allow us to pull data from more than one table at a time.

- This is both simple and powerful all at the same time.
