# Association in Java

- Association is a “has-a” type relationship.

- An association is a “using” relationship between two or more objects in which the objects have their own lifetime and there is no owner.

- Association establish the relationship b/w two classes using through their objects.

- Association relationship can be one to one, One to many, many to one and many to many.

- For example suppose we have two classes then these two classes are said to be “has-a” relationship if both of these entities share each other’s object for some work and at the same time they can exists without each others dependency or both have their own life time.

- As an example, imagine the relationship between a doctor and a patient. A doctor can be associated with multiple patients. At the same time, one patient can visit multiple doctors for treatment or consultation. Each of these objects has its own life cycle and there is no “owner” or parent. The objects that are part of the association relationship can be created and destroyed independently.
