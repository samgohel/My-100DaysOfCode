# Inheritance (IS-A relationship) in Java

- Inheritance is one of the key features of Object Oriented Programming.

- Inheritance provided mechanism that allowed a class to inherit property of another class.

- When a Class extends another class it inherits all non-private members including fields and methods.

- Inheritance in Java can be best understood in terms of Parent and Child relationship, also known as Super class(Parent) and Sub class(child) in Java language.

- Inheritance defines is-a relationship between a Super class and its Sub class. extends and implements keywords are used to describe inheritance in Java.

- It promotes the code reusability i.e the same methods and variables which are defined in a parent/super/base class can be used in the child/sub/derived class.

- It promotes polymorphism by allowing method overriding.

> ### Types of Inheritance

- Java mainly supports only three types of inheritance that are listed below.
  - Single Inheritance
  - Multilevel Inheritance
  - Hierarchical Inheritance

> ### Why multiple inheritance is not supported in Java?

- To remove ambiguity.
- To provide more maintainable and clear design.
