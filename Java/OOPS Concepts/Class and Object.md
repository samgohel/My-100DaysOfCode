# Class and Object In Java

> ### Class

- It can be defined as a template that describe the behaviors and states of a particular entity.

- A class defines new data type. Once defined this new type can be used to create object of that type.

- In Java, to declare a class class keyword is used.

- A class contain both data and methods that operate on that data.

- The data or variables defined within a class are called instance variables and the code that operates on this data is known as methods.

- The fields declared inside the class are known as instance variables. It gets memory when an object is created at runtime.

- if we donâ€™t initialized values of class fields then they are initialized with their default values.

- Class can be either abstract, final or concrete (normal class).

- It may optionally extend only one parent class. By default, it extends Object class.

- A Java class can contains fields, methods, constructors, and blocks.

- Methods in the class are similar to the functions that are used to perform operations and represent behavior of an object.

> ### Object

- Object is an instance of class.

- We Can also call it as physical existence of a logical template class.

- An object represents the class and consists of properties and behavior.

- Properties refer to the fields declared with in class and behavior represents to the methods available in the class.

- The new keyword creates an actual physical copy of the object and assign it to the variable. It will have physical existence and get memory in heap area. The new operator dynamically allocates memory for an object.
