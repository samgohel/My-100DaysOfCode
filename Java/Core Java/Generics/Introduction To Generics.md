# Generics Introduction In java

- Generic types are instantiated to form parameterized types by providing actual type arguments that replace the formal type parameters.

- A class like LinkedList<E> is a **_generic type_**, that has a **_type parameter_** E . Instantiations, such as LinkedList<Integer> or a LinkedList<String>, are called **_parameterized types_**, and String and Integer are the respective actual **_type arguments_**.
