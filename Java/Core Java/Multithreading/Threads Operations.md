# Joining threads in Java

- In java, isAlive() and join() are two different methods that are used to check whether a thread has finished its execution or not.

- The isAlive() method returns true if the thread upon which it is called is still running otherwise it returns false.

- join() method is used more commonly than isAlive(). This method waits until the thread on which it is called terminates.

- Using join() method, we tell our thread to wait until the specified thread completes its execution.
