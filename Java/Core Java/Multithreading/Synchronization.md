# Java Synchronization

- Synchronization is a process of handling resource accessibility by multiple thread requests.

- The main purpose of synchronization is to avoid thread interference.

- At times when more than one thread try to access a shared resource, we need to ensure that resource will be used by only one thread at a time.

- The process by which this is achieved is called synchronization

- The synchronization keyword in java creates a block of code referred to as critical section.
