# User defined Exception subclass in Java

- Java provides rich set of built-in exception classes like: ArithmeticException, IOException, NullPointerException etc.

- These exceptions are already set to trigger on pre-defined conditions such as when you divide a number by zero it triggers ArithmeticException.

- Apart from these classes, Java allows us to create our own exception class to provide own exception implementation.

- These type of exceptions are called user-defined exceptions or custom exceptions.

- we can create our own exception simply by extending java Exception class.
