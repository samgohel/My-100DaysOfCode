# Java Working And fundaments

1. Basics Of Java, JVM, and JDK

- JDK contains tools required to write Java programs, and JRE to execute them.
- It includes a compiler, Java application launcher, Appletviewer, etc.
- JVMs are available for many hardware and software platforms.
- java is platform-independent but JVM, JRE, and JDK are platform dependent because the configuration of each OS differs.
- JVM is a virtual machine or a program that provides a run-time environment in which java byte code can be executed.
- Java compiler compiles the source code into the Java bytecode.
- Java interpreter converts the bytecode into the machine-understandable format i.e. machine code
- Machine code interacts with the operating system.
