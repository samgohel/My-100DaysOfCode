# Array introduction in java

- Java array is an object which contains elements of a similar data type.

- array is an object of a dynamically generated class. Java array inherits the Object class, and implements the Serializable as well as Cloneable interfaces.

- Array index starts at 0, not 1.

- Array are mostly immutable data structure whose length cannot be changed once created, the mutable array is called list.

- The array needs a memory block for allocation, called consecutive memory location, this means even if you have a memory you cannot allocate a big array if memory is scattered.

- Searching by index in the array is O(1) but insert and delete is not easy because you may need to re-arrange the array.

- An array is mostly homogenous data structure this means you cannot store a string in an integer array and vice-versa.

- An array can be single dimension or multiple dimension. A two-dimensional array is known as Matrix and very useful in games to create 2D world using tiles.
