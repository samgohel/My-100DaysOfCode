# Algorithm Basics

> ### What Is an Algorithm?

- the algorithm defines as a collection of ambiguous instruction occurring in some specific sequence and such an algorithm should produce output for the given set of input in the finite amount of time

- An algorithm is an effective, efficient and best method which can be used to express solution of any problem within a finite amount of space and time in a well-defined formal language.

- Step by step procedure for solving any problem is known as algorithm.

- The sequence of instructions needed to solve any problem.

> ### what are the Properties of the Algorithm?

- **_Non-ambiguity_**

  - Instruction should be clear and precise.
  - Instruction should not denote any conflict meaning.
  - This property indicates the effectiveness of the algorithm

- **_Range Of Input_**

  - The range of input should be specified. This is because normally the algorithm is input driven and if the range of input is not being specified then algorithm can go in an infinite state.

- **_Multiplicity_**

  - The same algorithm can be represented into several different ways. That means we can write in simple English the sequence of instruction or we can write it in form of pseudo code. Similarly, for solving the same problem we can write several different algorithms.
  - The multiplicity of algorithms is not about providing different perspectives on one static object called an algorithm but about realizing how the algorithm is already many things at once.

- **_Speed_**

  - The algorithm is written using some specified ideas. But such algorithm should be efficient and should produce the output with fast speed.

- **_Finiteness_**
  - The algorithm should be finite. That means after performing required operations it should be terminate.
