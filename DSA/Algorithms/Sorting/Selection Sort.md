# Selection Sort

- It maintains two subarray for the given array.
  - The subarray is already sorted.
  - And the second subarray is unsorted.
- With every iteration of selection sort, an element is picked from the unsorted subarray and moved to the sorted subarray.

> ### Worst and Average Case Time Complexity

- O(n^2)

> ### Best Case Time Complexity

- O(n^2)

> ### Stable

- No

> ### Pros

- It is an in-place sorting algorithm, no additional temporary storage is required beyond what is needed to hold the original list.

> ### Cons

- Requires n-squared number of steps for sorting n elements.
