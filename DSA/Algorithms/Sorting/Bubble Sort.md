# Bubble Sort

- Works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.
  > ### Worst and Average Case Time Complexity

* Worst case occurs when array is reverse sorted.
* O(n^2)

> ### Best Case Time Complexity

- Best case occurs when array is already sorted.
- O(n)

> ### Auxiliary Space

- O(1)

> ### Sorting In Place

- Yes

> ### Stable

- Yes

> ### Pros

- Bubble sort algorithm is considered as very simple sorting technique since all you need to do is compare all the adjacent elements and swap them if they are in wrong order.

> ### Cons

- Main drawback of bubble sort is its time complexity which is O(N2) since all the pairs are compared, even when the original array is sorted.
