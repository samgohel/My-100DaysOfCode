# Cyclically rotate an array by one

> ## Using Temp Variable

- Store last element in the temp variable
- Shift all the element one position
- Replace first element with temp variable
- **_Time Complexity_**
  - O(n)

> ## Two Pointer approach

- We can use two pointer i and j which point to first and last element of the array.
- We keep changing the index of i to index of j
