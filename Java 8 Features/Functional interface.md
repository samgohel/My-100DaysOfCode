# Functional Interfaces Basic

> ### What is Functional Interface?

- An interface with exactly one abstract method is called Functional Interface.

- @FunctionalInterface annotation is added so that we can mark an interface as functional interface (itâ€™s best practice).

- If the interface is annotated with @FunctionalInterface annotation and we try to have more than one abstract method, it throws compiler error.

> ### Why we have Functional Interfaces?

- Functional Interface serves as a data type for Lambda expressions. Since a Functional interface contains only one abstract method, the implementation of that method becomes the code that gets passed as an argument to another method.

- Functional Interfaces are mainly used in Lambda expressions, Method reference and constructor references.

* Collections API has been rewritten and new Stream API is introduced that uses a lot of functional interfaces.
