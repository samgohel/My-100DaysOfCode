# Working With Lambda

> ### Important rules of lambda.

- if the body of lambda expression contain only one statement then curly braces are optional.

- Java compiler also enter the type of variable passed in arguments, hence type is optional.

> ### Interface Basics

- we can implement interface by any of following method
  - crete class and provide implementation to interface
  - we can provide implementation using anonymous class.
  - we can use lambda expression to provide implementation (only valid for functional interface).
